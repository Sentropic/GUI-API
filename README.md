# GUI API
API plugin for display of visual elements in the player's screen.
## For server owners:
You can dd this plugin to your server for mainly two purposes:
* Resolve conflicting action bar texts coming from different plugins
* Make depending plugins work!
## For developers:
Use as a dependency of your plugin to display custom elements (for example using a resource pack), where you get to choose the position and priority of each GUI component.
